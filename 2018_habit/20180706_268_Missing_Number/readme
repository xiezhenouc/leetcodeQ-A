question:
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

analysis
遍历求和，sum[0..n] - cur_sum = missing value
