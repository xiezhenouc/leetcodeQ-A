question
Given a list of positive integers, the adjacent integers will perform the float division. For example, [2,3,4] -> 2 / 3 / 4.

However, you can add any number of parenthesis at any position to change the priority of operations. You should find out how to add parenthesis to get the maximum result, and return the corresponding expression in string format. Your expression should NOT contain redundant parenthesis.

anlaysis
x1 / x2 / x3 ...
x1总是分子
x2总是分母
x1 / x2 / x3 ... = x1 / x2 * Y
那么后面的Y结果最大即可，Y最大即为x3 * x4 * x5 ...

即为
x1/(x2/x3....)
